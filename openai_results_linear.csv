It will compare the nodes at each level of the tree, and return false if the nodes have different values or if one node is missing in one of the trees. The algorithm will only return true if all nodes in both trees are the same.

At each level, the function checks if both nodes are null, indicating we've reached the end of both trees and they must be the same. Then it checks if either node is null, indicating that one tree is missing a node and they cannot be the same. If both nodes have the same value, we then recursively check their left and right children. If both children are the same, the function returns true. If at any point nodes are found to be different, the function returns false.","```python

            We will solve this problem using the Inorder traversal of the binary search tree.

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.
2. If the previous node's value is greater than the current node's value, it means they are swapped. So, mark the first such node as `first` and the second such node as `second`.
3. After completing the Inorder traversal, swap the values of the `first` and `second` nodes.
4. This approach is implemented in all four languages: C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

            Input:
            The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.","```python

1. Traverse the left subtree, and call the function recursively for the left child.

In each call to the function, we try to add one part to the IP address. If 4 parts have been added and we have reached the end of the input string, we have found a valid IP address and add it to the result list.

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

This process is repeated for all valid parts and combinations, eventually forming all possible valid IP addresses.","```python

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

This will sort the colors in the required order with a linear-time complexity, as we only go through the array once with the `white` pointer. Also, it sorts the colors in-place without the need for additional storage.","```python

            The algorithm uses binary search on an m x n matrix.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

If the search space has been fully explored and the target is not found, we return false.","```python

            The idea is to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m` x `n` to store the number of unique paths to reach each cell in the grid.

Initially, we fill out the first row and first column of the `dp` array with 1 since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column: by moving either right along the first row or down along the first column.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left. We can do this because the robot can only move down or right, so the paths to the current cell must have come from those two directions.

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.","```python

To minimize the rotations, we find the remainder of `k` divided by the length of the list.

2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

            The algorithm uses the binary exponentiation technique, which is a faster method of calculating x^n compared to the naive approach. It relies on the process of repeatedly multiplying the current product by itself and updating it after each iteration. The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.","```python

            We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.","```python

            Input:
            The algorithm uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations. It works by swapping the elements in the input array in a recursive manner.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.
2. For each index, we iterate from `index` to the end of the array, performing the following steps:
    a. Swap `index` and `i` elements.
    b. Recursively call the helper function with `index + 1`.
    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array. The termination condition for the recursion is the base case when we reach the end of the array. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), as there are N! permutations of an array of N elements.","```python

It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.","```python

2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

            We can solve this problem by following the steps below:

1. Identify the largest index `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is sorted in descending order, so we just need to reverse the array.
2. Identify the largest index `l` greater than `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[l]`.
3. Swap the value of `nums[k]` with that of `nums[l]`.
4. Reverse the sub-array `nums[k + 1:]` which is guaranteed to be in non-increasing order.

By making these changes in place and only using constant extra memory, we obtain the next permutation of the array nums.","```python

2. Calculate the sign of the result based on the signs of dividend and divisor.
3. We use the bitwise shift operator to handle divisions by powers of 2. In each iteration, we initialize the temp variable as the absolute value of the divisor to calculate how many times it fits into the remaining dividend. We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.

            Input:
            The algorithm uses recursion to solve the problem. It starts by checking if the list has remaining pairs to swap. If not, the head of the current section of the list is returned.

If there are pairs left to swap, it takes the second node (which will become the new head of the current pair) and sets its next node to the result of the recursive call with the node after it as the new head.

Then, it sets the current head's next node to the second node and returns the second node as the new head of the pair. As the recursion unfolds, the pairs get swapped, and the final swapped linked list head is returned.","```python

            Input:
            The algorithm follows a divide and conquer approach to merge all linked lists into one sorted linked-list. 

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(kN) and a space complexity of O(1), where k is the number of linked-lists, and N is the total number of nodes across all linked-lists.","```python

            The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.","```python

            Input:
            The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, with one pointer starting from the left end and the other from the right end. It calculates the area between these two lines and updates the maximum area if the current area is larger than the previously calculated maximum area. If the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer, it moves the left pointer to the right. Otherwise, it moves the right pointer to the left. The algorithm continues until the pointers meet.

This algorithm ensures that the maximum area is found without having to check all possible pairs of lines because it always chooses the pair of lines with the maximum possible distance and minimum height difference at each step.","```python

            Input:
            We use Dynamic Programming to solve this problem. We store intermediate results in a 2D boolean array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`. We then loop through the characters of both strings and update the `dp` table.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

Finally, `dp[m][n]` stores the result, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `p` respectively.","```python

            Here is the algorithm:

1. If the integer is negative, immediately return false, as negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
2. Create a variable named `original` to store the original integer value and `reversed` initialized with 0 to store the reversed integer value.
3. Iterate through the integer while it's greater than zero and, in each iteration, perform the following operations:
   a. Multiply the `reversed` value by 10 and add the modulus of the integer (x) by 10.
   b. Divide the integer (x) by 10, discarding the remainder.
4. Compare `original` and `reversed` integers; if they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

This approach requires O(log10(n)) time complexity as we are dividing the input by 10 in each iteration.","```python
