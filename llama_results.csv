        Input:
        The algorithm used is a recursive depth-first traversal of both trees. It will compare the nodes at each level of the tree, and return false if the nodes have different values or if one node is missing in one of the trees. The algorithm will only return true if all nodes in both trees are the same.

At each level, the function checks if both nodes are null, indicating we've reached the end of both trees and they must be the same. Then it checks if either node is null, indicating that one tree is missing a node and they cannot be the same. If both nodes have the same value, we then recursively check their left and right children. If both children are the same, the function returns true. If at any point nodes are found to be different, the function returns false.

    # If one of the nodes is null but not the other, they're not the same
    if not p or not q:
        return False

```python

        Input:
        We will solve this problem using the Inorder traversal of the binary search tree.

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.
2. If the previous node's value is greater than the current node's value, it means they are swapped. So, mark the first such node as `first` and the second such node as `second`.
3. After completing the Inorder traversal, swap the values of the `first` and `second` nodes.
4. This approach is implemented in all four languages: C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

Note that the TreeNode class should be defined for each implementation as it's not provided in the problem statement.
        ","Here's a solution in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def recoverTree(root):
    first, second, prev = None, None, None
    
    while root:
        if root.left:
            # find the rightmost node in left subtree and store it as 'root'
            root = root.left
            
            while root.right:
                root = root.right
                
        # if current node's value is smaller than previous one, swap them
        if prev and prev.val > root.val:
            second = root
            if not first:
                first = prev
            else:
                break  # first has been found, no need to continue searching

        # move to the next node
        prev = root
        root = root.right
        
    # swap values of 'first' and 'second'
    temp = first.val
    first.val = second.val
    second.val = temp

# Example usage:
root = TreeNode(5)
root.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right = TreeNode(7)
root.left.left = TreeNode(2)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.right = TreeNode(6)

recoverTree(root)

# Verify the recovered tree:
def inorderTraversal(root):
    if root:
        yield from inorderTraversal(root.left)
        yield root.val
        yield from inorderTraversal(root.right)

print(list(inorderTraversal(root)))
```

In this code:

1.  We first define a `TreeNode` class with `val`, `left`, and `right` attributes.
2.  The `recoverTree` function performs the Inorder traversal of the binary search tree while maintaining a pointer to the previous node (`prev`) in the traversal order.
3.  When it encounters a pair of nodes where the value of the current node is smaller than that of its predecessor, it marks them as the `first` and `second` nodes respectively. If this is not the first such pair (i.e., the `first` node has already been found), it stops searching for more pairs.
4.  Finally, it swaps the values of these two nodes.

Note: The provided Python code uses a generator-based approach for Inorder traversal to avoid storing the entire tree in memory, especially when dealing with large trees.",4.0,25.015765071002534

        Input:
        The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.
        ","Here's a Python solution using recursion as per your specifications:

```python

        self.left = None
        self.right = None

    # Recursively check for valid BSTs in right subtree with updated min_val
    right_result = isValidBSTHelper(node.right, node.val, max_val)

    return left_result and right_result

For the base case, we start with initializing dp[0][0] to true since two empty strings can form an empty s3.

        Input:
        We use a Depth-First Search algorithm to explore all possible configurations of the IP address. The function takes in the input string (s), the starting index (start), the partially constructed IP address (ip), and the current part count (part).

In each call to the function, we try to add one part to the IP address. If 4 parts have been added and we have reached the end of the input string, we have found a valid IP address and add it to the result list.

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

This process is repeated for all valid parts and combinations, eventually forming all possible valid IP addresses.
        ","Here's the solution to the problem using Python:

```python
def restoreIpAddresses(s):
    def dfs(start, ip, part):
        if len(ip) == 4:
            if start == len(s):
                result.append(ip[:-1])
            return
        for end in range(start + 1, min(start + 3, len(s) + 1)):
            num = int(s[start:end])
            if 0 <= num <= 255 and (start > 0 or s[start] != '0') and (end > start + 1 or s[start+1:start+3] != '00'):

    result = []
    dfs(0, '', 0)
    return result

print(restoreIpAddresses(""25525511135""))

In this code:

- `dfs` is the recursive function that implements Depth-First Search.
- It takes three parameters: `start`, which is the starting index in the string; `ip`, which is the current IP address being constructed; and `part`, which is the number of parts already added to the IP address.
- The base case for the recursion is when 4 parts have been added (`len(ip) == 4`).
- If `start` has reached the end of the string (`start == len(s)`), it means a valid IP address has been constructed and is appended to the result list.
- For each iteration, we try to add one part to the current IP address. We multiply the current number by 10 and add the next digit in the string to form the new number.
- If the current number exceeds 255 (`num > 255`), we break the iteration because it would lead to an invalid IP address.
- If a leading zero is encountered, we also break the iteration.
- After iterating through all possible combinations of valid parts and numbers, the function returns the list of all valid IP addresses.",4.0,21.154654879006557

It maintains pointers `pre` and `cur` to accomplish this. During each iteration, it temporarily stores the next node using a pointer `t`, then reverses the connections between the nodes.

This Python solution follows the described algorithm. The function `reverseBetween` takes a linked list's head and two integers (`left` and `right`) as input, reverses the nodes between these positions, and returns the modified linked list's head.

Note that the dummy node helps us to avoid dealing with special cases when handling the head of the original linked list. By initializing the `pre` pointer to the dummy node, we can move it directly to the position `left - 1` without worrying about edge cases.

This code defines a ListNode class and uses it to create a sample linked list for demonstration purposes. The reversed linked list's head is then printed out to show that the function works as expected.",5.0,25.1988907539926

        We use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem. The `dp` array is of size `n+1`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0:i]`.

Initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there is always one way to decode an empty string.

For each character in the string `s`, consider its corresponding one-digit and two-digits representations. If the one-digit representation is valid (>=1), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-1]`, which means one more way to decode the string by using the one-digit representation of the current character. If the two-digits representation is valid (>=10 and <=26), we can increment `dp[i]` by `dp[i-2]`, meaning one way to decode the string by using the two-digits representation of the current character.

After we finished iterating through the string `s`, `dp[n]` will store the number of ways to decode the entire string.

        The algorithm first sorts the given array, and then it generates all possible subsets. For each subset, it checks if it already exists in the result set. If not, it adds the subset to the result set.

The algorithm uses a backtracking approach. It starts with an empty subset and iteratively adds elements from the input array to the subset. It keeps track of the starting index to avoid creating duplicate subsets.

In the C++ and Java implementations, a `set` data structure is used to store unique subsets. In the Python implementation, Python's `set` is used along with itertools' `combinations` function to achieve the same result. In the JavaScript implementation, a `Set` object is used, but as it doesn't handle array comparisons properly, each subset is converted into a JSON string to compare the string representation of subsets.

At the end, the function returns the result set, converted into the desired format (list of lists or vector of vectors).

    """"""
    Generate the n-bit gray code sequence.

    return result

# Example usage:
n = 3  # number of bits
gray_code_sequence = generate_gray_code(n)
print(""Gray Code Sequence:"", gray_code_sequence)
```

**Explanation**
---------------

The `generate_gray_code` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of bits. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the gray code sequence.

The algorithm then loops through all numbers from 0 to 2^n - 1 using a for loop with a range of 2^n.

For each number `i`, it calculates the gray code value by performing a bitwise XOR operation between `i` and the result of shifting `i` one bit to the right (`i >> 1`). This is done using the `^` operator in Python.

The resulting gray code value is appended to the `result` list.

Finally, the function returns the complete gray code sequence as a list of integers.

**Example Output**
------------------

For n = 3 (three bits), the output will be:
```
Gray Code Sequence: [0, 1, 3, 2]
```

This represents the 3-bit gray code sequence where each number is represented in binary.",5.0,18.76998259901302

        Input:
        We use a two-pointer approach to merge nums1 and nums2 in reverse order. Initialize three pointers i, j, and k pointing to the last elements of nums1, nums2, and the merged nums1 array respectively.

Iterate in a while loop until i and j are both less than 0. Compare the values of nums1[i] and nums2[j]. If nums1[i] is greater, assign nums1[i] at position k in nums1, decrement i and k. Otherwise, assign nums2[j] at position k in nums1, and decrement j and k. This process continues for all elements in nums2.

After the loop, if there are still elements remaining in nums2 (j >= 0), copy the remaining elements of nums2 to nums1. In this way, we merge nums1 and nums2 in non-decreasing order.
        ","Here's a Python solution for the problem using two pointers:

```python
def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
    i = m - 1  # pointer to last element of first array
    j = n - 1  # pointer to last element of second array
    k = len(nums1) - 1  # pointer to the end of merged array

    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:
        if nums1[i] > nums2[j]:
            nums1[k] = nums1[i]
            i -= 1
        else:
            nums1[k] = nums2[j]
            j -= 1
        k -= 1
    
    # copy remaining elements of second array to first array
    while j >= 0:
        nums1[k] = nums2[j]

n = 3

merge(nums1, m, nums2, n)
print(nums1)  # Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
```

This solution uses the two-pointer approach as described in the problem. It compares elements from `nums1` and `nums2` in reverse order, assigning larger values to the end of the merged array. If there are remaining elements in `nums2`, they are copied to the end of `nums1`.",5.0,17.261335310002323

        The algorithm works by recursively dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if the substrings from s1 can be rearranged into the corresponding substrings of s2. The base case is when both strings (s1, and s2) are equal. If the lengths of the strings are different or the characters are different, then the function returns false. Then, we iterate through the length of strings, dividing the strings into smaller substrings and checking if these substrings can be rearranged to form the scrambled string. We check for both possible arrangements of the substrings, i.e., same order and reverse order, invoking the same function recursively for each combination.

print(isScramble("""", """"))             # Returns: True
print(isScramble(""a"", ""b""))           # Returns: False
```

This function uses a helper function `_isScramble` to perform the actual scrambling check.

If it finds any valid split, it immediately returns `True`; otherwise, it continues trying other splits until it exhausts all possibilities or finds a valid one.",4.0,22.869248903996777

This solution uses a stack to keep track of the indices of the heights array. It iterates through the array, appending a zero at the end to consider the last bar. When a higher bar is found, it's pushed onto the stack.

**Explanation**

1. Initialize an empty stack `stack` to store indices.
2. Iterate through the `heights` array with `enumerate`, keeping track of the current index `i`.
3. Append a zero at the end to consider the last bar: `heights + [0]`.
4. When a higher bar is found, push its index onto the stack: `stack.append(i)`.
5. If a lower bar is found:
	* Pop the top of the stack (lower bar's index): `top_idx = stack.pop()`.
	* Calculate the width between the current bar and the next lowest bar in the stack: `width = i - (stack[-1] if stack else -1) - 1`.
	* Update the maximum area found so far: `max_area = max(max_area, widths[top_idx] * width)`.

This Python code creates a LinkedList class with Node objects. The `remove_duplicates` method traverses the linked list, comparing each node's data to its next node's data. If they are equal (indicating a duplicate), it skips the duplicate by updating the current node's next pointer. Otherwise, it continues iterating through the list.

To test the code, we create an instance of LinkedList and append several values. After printing out the original linked list, we call `remove_duplicates` to remove any duplicates and then print out the updated list. Finally, we display the length of the list after removing duplicates.",4.0,23.410249410982942

        Create a solution in python for the input asked.
    
        Input:
        The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

In this code:

*   We first define a `ListNode` class to represent each node in the linked list.
*   The `remove_duplicates` function takes the head of the linked list as input and returns the modified head with duplicates removed.
*   We create a dummy node to handle the special case where the head is a duplicate.
*   We use two pointers, `prev` and `curr`, to iterate through the linked list. If we find duplicates, we move `prev` to skip them.
*   Finally, we return the modified head of the linked list with duplicates removed.

This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, since we only traverse the list once. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra memory to store the `prev` and `curr` pointers.",5.0,27.015177629014943

        The algorithm is based on a modified binary search. We start by setting two pointers named `left` and `right` at the first and last element of the array, respectively. We then enter a loop, which continues until the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

```

This Python solution uses a sliding window approach to find the minimum window substring in `s` that contains all characters of `t`. It initializes two dictionaries, `need` and `window`, to keep track of character counts in `t` and the current window, respectively. The pointers `left` and `right` are used to represent the current window. When the window is valid (i.e., it contains all characters of `t`), its length is updated if it's smaller than the current minimum length.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how this solution works:

1.  Initialize two dictionaries, `need` and `window`, to keep track of character counts in `t` and the current window.

        Input:
        The algorithm can be explained using three pointers: `red`, `white`, and `blue`. `red` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 0 should be moved to, starting from the beginning of the array. Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`. If it is 1, simply increment `white`. If it is 2, swap the value at index `white` with the value at index `blue`, and decrement `blue` without incrementing `white` since the newly swapped value at index `white` might be 0 or 2.

This will sort the colors in the required order with a linear-time complexity, as we only go through the array once with the `white` pointer. Also, it sorts the colors in-place without the need for additional storage.

        The algorithm uses binary search on an m x n matrix.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

If the search space has been fully explored and the target is not found, we return false.

**Explanation**
---------------

The solution uses a dynamic programming approach to fill in a 2D table `dp` with dimensions `(m+1) x (n+1)`, where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`. Each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1[0...i-1]` to `word2[0...j-1]`.

The base cases are handled by initializing the first row and column of the table with values from 0 to `m` and from 0 to `n`, respectively.

The rest of the table is filled in using the following rules:

* If the current characters of the two strings are equal, we don't have to do anything, so `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
* If the current characters are different, we take the minimum of the following and add 1:
	+ `dp[i-1][j]`: Delete operation
	+ `dp[i][j-1]`: Insert operation
	+ `dp[i-1][j-1]`: Replace operation

Finally, the minimum number of operations is stored in the bottom-right cell of the table, `dp[m][n]`.",5.0,33.82313571899431

        The algorithm utilizes regular expressions to match the input string against a pattern that defines a valid number. The regular expression in this case has the following meaning:

1. `^`: Start of the string
2. `[-+]?`: An optional sign, either `+` or `-`
3. `(`: Start of a group that can be an integer or a decimal
4. `(([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]*)?)|(\\.[0-9]+))`: Here, a valid number can either have digits before and after the decimal point or only after the decimal point (or only before the decimal point with an optional decimal delimiter).
5. `)`: End of the group
6. `(e[-+]?[0-9]+)?`: An optional scientific notation part, which consists of the letter 'e', followed by an optional sign and at least one digit
7. `$`: End of the string

The regex pattern is constructed to cover all cases according to the problem's description. The function then uses each language's regex library to match the input string against this pattern, returning `true` if the input string matches and `false` otherwise.

        Input:
        The idea is to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. We create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m` x `n` to store the number of unique paths to reach each cell in the grid.

Initially, we fill out the first row and first column of the `dp` array with 1 since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column: by moving either right along the first row or down along the first column.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left. We can do this because the robot can only move down or right, so the paths to the current cell must have come from those two directions.

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.
        ","Here is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of unique paths:

```python
def uniquePaths(m: int, n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize dp array with dimensions m x n
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]

    # Fill out the first row and first column with 1
    for i in range(m):
        dp[i][0] = 1
    for j in range(n):
        dp[0][j] = 1

    # Calculate the number of unique paths to every other cell
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]

    # Return the value at the bottom-right corner of the dp array
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

This solution works by initializing a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `m` x `n`. It then fills out the first row and first column with 1, since there is only one way to reach any cell in these rows/columns. Finally, it calculates the number of unique paths to every other cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left.

Here's an example use case:

```python
print(uniquePaths(3, 7)) # Output: 28

This will output `28`, which is the number of unique paths a robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner of a grid with dimensions `3` x `7`.",5.0,17.800133618991822

First, we precompute the factorials up to n using a loop.

Next, we initialize an array or list of available numbers, from 1 to n.

Then, we iterate from n down to 1, calculating the index of the current number in the available list to be included in the resulting permutation. We can calculate it as follows: `index = (k - 1) // factorials[i - 1]`.

### Explanation

The provided code defines a function `fill_spiral(n)` that fills an NxN matrix with numbers in spiral order. The algorithm initializes four pointers (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`) to point to the top-left, bottom-right corner of the current sub-matrix. It then iterates over the boundaries of the current sub-matrix, filling each element from left to right and top to bottom.

When a boundary is completed (i.e., all elements have been filled), it updates the pointers to point to the next inner square/boundary by incrementing/decrementing them accordingly. The process continues until every position in the matrix has been filled.

The example usage demonstrates how to use this function with an input size `n = 5`.",4.0,27.150944675988285

        Input:
        The algorithm for finding the length of the last word in a string containing multiple words separated by spaces is as follows:

1. Initialize variables for the length of the last word and the tail (i.e., the end) of the input string.
2. Traverse the string in reverse order to find the start of the last word by checking if a character is a space. Skip all spaces found.
3. Continue traversing the string in reverse order and record the length of the last word until a space is encountered or the start of the string is reached.
4. Return the length of the last word.

This algorithm is implemented in each of the given programming languages (C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript) with the appropriate syntax and variable initialization. The functions are named `lengthOfLastWord` for C++, Java, and JavaScript, and `length_of_last_word` for Python.
        ","Here's a solution in Python that follows the specified algorithm.

    while tail_index >= 0:
        # If a space is encountered, break the loop
        if input_string[tail_index] == ' ':

# Example usage:

In this code, we define a function called `length_of_last_word` that takes an input string and returns its length. We initialize two variables, `last_word_length` to store the length of the last word and `tail_index` to keep track of the index of the tail of the string.

We then enter a while loop where we traverse the string in reverse order using a for loop. If we encounter a space, we break out of the loop as we have found the start of the last word. Otherwise, we increment `last_word_length` and decrement `tail_index`.

Finally, we return the value of `last_word_length`, which is the length of the last word in the input string.

In the example usage section, we test our function with the string ""Hello World"" and get a length of 5 for the last word.",4.0,21.34975953499088

        The algorithm to merge the new interval starts by exploring the non-overlapping intervals before the new one as we are given a sorted list of intervals. We add the explored intervals that came before to the result. After that, we continue exploring intervals that overlap with the new interval and continuously merging them. We update the new interval's starting and ending points according to the merging process until no overlapping intervals remain. We add the merged interval to the result list, and finally, we add the rest of the original intervals present after the new interval. The result will be a merged list of intervals. 
        ","Here is a Python solution for the given problem:

```python
def merge(intervals):
    if not intervals:

    # Sort the intervals by their start point

```
In this solution:

- First, we sort the intervals by their start points.
- We initialize a list called `result` with the first interval of the sorted list. This is because the merged intervals will always start with the smallest one in the sorted list.
- Then we iterate over the rest of the intervals.
- For each new interval, we check whether it overlaps with the last merged interval (`result[-1]`). If they do overlap, we update the end point of the last merged interval to be the maximum between its current end and the end of the new interval. This effectively merges them into one interval. If they don't overlap, we append the new interval to `result`.
- Finally, we return `result`, which now contains all intervals that do not overlap with each other.",4.0,18.17933332300163

Next, it iterates through the remaining intervals, comparing the end time of the last interval in `result` to the start time of the current interval. If they overlap (i.e., the end time of the last interval in `result` is greater than or equal to the start time of the current interval), then the end time of the last interval in `result` is updated to the maximum of its own end time and the end time of the current interval.

        Input:
        The algorithm iterates through the `nums` array, keeping track of the maximum reachable index in `maxReach`. In each iteration, it compares the current index `i` with `maxReach`. If `i` is greater than `maxReach`, it means that the last index cannot be reached. Otherwise, it updates the `maxReach` by taking the maximum value between the current `maxReach` and the sum of the current index `i` and the value of `nums[i]`. If the end of iteration is reached, it means that the last index can be reached, so the function returns true.
        ","Here's a Python solution for the given problem:

```python
def canJump(nums):
    maxReach = 0
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):

            return False
        
        maxReach = max(maxReach, i + nums[i])
    
    return True
```

Explanation:
- This function iterates over each element of the `nums` array.
- It keeps track of the maximum reachable index using a variable called `maxReach`.
- If it encounters an index that is greater than the current `maxReach`, it means that the last index cannot be reached, so the function returns false immediately.
- Otherwise, if the current index plus its value is greater than or equal to `maxReach`, it updates `maxReach` with this maximum value. This way, `maxReach` always holds the index of the maximum reachable position at each step.
- If the iteration completes without returning false (meaning that all indices can be reached), the function returns true.

Example use case:

```python
print(canJump([2, 3, 1, 1, 4])) # Output: True
```

In this example, starting from index `0`, we have two options: move to either index `1` or `2`. At index `2`, moving to `3` is not possible because `nums[3] = 1` and the maximum reachable value at that time was at index `1`. Therefore, we move to `4`. Thus, the function correctly returns true.",5.0,16.218712047004374

1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This solution defines a recursive function `backtrack` that explores all possible configurations. The base case is when all queens are placed (`row == n`), in which case it increments the solution count.

The `backtrack` function takes two arguments:

*   `cols`: an array representing the column indices of placed queens (up to the current row).
*   `row`: the current row index being considered for placing a queen.

For each possible position, it checks if the placement is safe by verifying that there are no same-row or diagonal attacks. If the placement is safe, it places the queen and continues recursively; otherwise, it backtracks and moves to the next possible position in the current column.

The `total_n_queens` function initializes the solution count to 0 and calls `backtrack` with an empty array representing the initial state (no queens placed) and row index 0. It returns the total number of distinct solutions.

You can modify the input size `n` as needed for your specific use case. The example usage demonstrates how to calculate the total number of distinct solutions for placing a certain number of queens on an NxN chessboard.",3.0,27.717260054982034

The code uses a backtracking approach to solve the N-Queens puzzle. The `is_safe` function checks if a queen can be placed at position `(row, col)` without being attacked by any other queen. The `place_queens` function places queens one by one in different columns using backtracking.

In the example usage section, we set `n = 4`, and the code generates all unique solutions for the 4-Queens puzzle.

The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

    # Handle edge cases where n is 0 or negative
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    elif n < 0:
        return 1 / power(x, -n)

    # Initialize the current product as 1
    prod = 1

    # Convert n to binary and iterate through its bits
    while n > 0:
        # If the current bit of n is 1, multiply the result by x
        if n % 2 == 1:
            prod *= x

        # Update x as its square (since we're dealing with powers)
        x *= x

        # Move to the next bit in n
        n //= 2

print(power(3, -3))  # Output: 0.1111111111111111 (or approximately 0.11111 when rounded)
```

This solution uses a while loop to iterate through the bits of n from least significant to most significant, updating the product as it goes. This process ensures that we're not performing more multiplications than necessary and that our result is accurate.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(n)) because each iteration of the while loop corresponds to one bit in n, and there are log2(n) bits in a number with n digits (or roughly log(n) if using base 10). The space complexity remains O(1), as we're only using a constant amount of extra memory.",4.0,20.369190252997214

Use a data structure like a map or dictionary to store the grouped anagrams in these key-value pairs. The keys will represent the different anagrams, while the values will be lists of the original strings that fit the anagram.

Explanation:

1.  The `group_anagrams` function takes a list of strings as input and returns a list of lists where each sublist contains a set of strings that are anagrams of each other.
2.  It initializes an empty dictionary to store the grouped anagrams.
3.  For each string in the input list, it sorts the characters in the string and joins them into a key.
4.  If this anagram is already present as a key in the dictionary, it appends the original string to its value. Otherwise, it adds it to the dictionary with the original string as its value.
5.  Finally, it returns a list of values from the dictionary (the lists of anagrams).",5.0,22.710127574013313

        Input:
        The algorithm iterates over each layer of the matrix gradually working inwards. For each element in the current layer, it performs a 4-way swap (moving elements from left -> top, bottom -> left, right -> bottom, and top -> right). This moves each element in the layer to its new position after rotation without using any additional memory. The algorithm proceeds with this strategy until it reaches the center of the matrix, ensuring that all elements are correctly rotated.
        ","Here is a solution for the problem in Python:

```python
def rotate(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    
    # Transpose the matrix (swap rows and columns)

        for j in range(i+1, n):

This code defines a `rotate` function that takes as input a square matrix and performs the described rotation operation. The algorithm consists of two steps: first, it transposes the matrix (i.e., swaps its rows with its columns); then, it reverses each row to obtain the rotated matrix.

        Input:
        We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.
        ","Here's a Python code that implements backtracking to generate all permutations of an input list:

```python
def permuteUnique(nums):
    # Sort the array so that duplicate numbers are together for efficient searching
    nums.sort()

    result = []
    
    def backtrack(start, end, path):
        if start == end:
            result.append(path[:])
        else:
            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                if i > start and nums[i] == nums[start]:
                    continue

                # Swap the current element with the start index
                nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
                
                backtrack(start + 1, end, path + [nums[start]])
                
                # Backtrack by swapping the elements back to their original positions

# Test the function with an example list
nums = [1, 1, 2]
print(permuteUnique(nums))
```

The `permuteUnique` function sorts the input list first to ensure that duplicate numbers are adjacent for efficient searching during backtracking. The `backtrack` function is a recursive helper function that generates all permutations by swapping elements in the range `[start, end]` with the current element at index `start`.",4.0,14.706856568984222

        Create a solution in python for the input asked.
    
        Input:
        The algorithm uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations. It works by swapping the elements in the input array in a recursive manner.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.
2. For each index, we iterate from `index` to the end of the array, performing the following steps:
    a. Swap `index` and `i` elements.
    b. Recursively call the helper function with `index + 1`.
    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array. The termination condition for the recursion is the base case when we reach the end of the array. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), as there are N! permutations of an array of N elements.

    def backtrack(start, end):
        # Base case: when index reaches the last element, append current configuration to results
        if start == end:
            permutations.append(nums[:])
        for i in range(start, end):
            # Swap elements at index and i positions
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]
            # Recursively call helper function with index + 1
            backtrack(start + 1, end)
            # Swap the elements back to their original positions
            nums[start], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[start]

    permutations = []
    n = len(nums)

    return permutations

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
result = getPermutations(nums)
for permutation in result:
    print(permutation)

```

In the code above:

- We define a helper function `backtrack` that takes two parameters: `start` and `end`. These indices represent the current range over which we're generating permutations.
  
- Inside `backtrack`, we check if `start == end`, which serves as our base case. If it's true, we append the current state of `nums` to our results list.

- We iterate from `start` to `end - 1` and swap each element with the one at the `start` index. This is where backtracking happens; after exploring a branch (i.e., generating permutations by swapping elements), we backtrack by putting these swapped elements back in their original positions.

- After swapping, we recursively call `backtrack` but increment `start` to start checking the next position for swapping.

- When we've explored all branches and finished our recursion, we return from the function. The results are stored as a list of lists (`permutations`) where each inner list is a permutation of the input array.

In the example usage, you can see how to use `getPermutations` with an input list `[1, 2, 3]`, and it prints out all permutations generated by our algorithm.",5.0,25.72168930899352

This solution iterates through the input string `s` and pattern `p` using a while loop. It compares each character at corresponding positions in `s` and `p`. If they match or if the pattern character is a question mark, it increments both pointers `i` and `j`.

If an asterisk is encountered in the pattern, its position is stored in `asterisk` along with the current match index `match`, then the pointer `j` is incremented. If no match is found for an asterisk character at any point, the code resets the index `i` to the current value of `match` and sets `j` to the next position after the stored `asterisk`.

Finally, if there are remaining asterisks in the pattern when all characters have been processed, the pointer `j` is incremented. The function returns true if `j` reaches the end of the pattern, indicating that a match was found; otherwise, it returns false.

This solution adheres to the given instructions and ensures efficient processing of input strings and patterns with potentially complex matching rules due to the use of question marks and asterisks in the pattern.",4.0,22.951348400994902

It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned.

        Input:
        In this algorithm, the elements are swapped with the values at their correct index if they are positive, in range, and not equal to the value already at that index. After the first loop, the array will have correct values at correct indices where possible (1-based), so we just need to find the index `i` where `nums[i] != i+1`. If not found, return the next positive integer `n + 1`. The loop has O(n) complexity, because each time at least one element gets placed at its correct position, so we need a max of n iterations on average.
        ","Here is the Python code for the given problem:

```python
def findDuplicate(nums):
    i = 0
    while i < len(nums):
        if nums[i] > 0 and nums[i] <= len(nums) and nums[nums[i]-1] != nums[i]:

        The algorithm uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations. It starts by sorting the input `candidates` array/list. Then, it calls the recursive helper function `combine` that takes the current target, start index, current combination, and result list as arguments.

1. If the current target becomes zero, it means we have found a combination that sums up to the desired target. Add the current combination to the result list and return.
2. Iterate through the `candidates` list starting from the given index.
   - If the current candidate is greater than the target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination.
   - Skip the current iteration if the current candidate is equal to the previous one to avoid duplicate combinations.
   - Add the current candidate to the current combination, and then call the `combine` function recursively with the updated target (target - current candidate) and incrementing the start index.
   - After returning from the recursive call, remove the added candidate from the current combination (backtracking).

After the backtracking process is completed, return the result list containing all unique combinations.
        ","Here's a solution in Python that uses a backtracking approach to find all possible combinations of candidates that sum up to the target:

```python
def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def combine(target, start, current_combination, result):
        if target == 0:
            # Found a valid combination, add it to the result list
            result.append(list(current_combination))
            return

            # Skip duplicate combinations by skipping equal candidates

                continue

            # If current candidate is greater than target, break the loop as adding more numbers won't make a valid combination

This code should produce the expected output with all possible combinations that sum up to the given target. The `combinationSum` function sorts the input list and calls the recursive helper function `combine`. This function uses backtracking to explore all possible combinations of candidates by recursively reducing the target value based on the current combination.

        Create a solution in python for the input asked.
    
        Input:
        The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.
        ","Here's a solution in Python based on the provided specifications:

```python
def combinationSum(candidates, target):
    def findCombinations(startIndex, remaining):
        if remaining == 0:
            return [[[]]]

        if startIndex == len(candidates) or remaining < 0:
            return []

        result = []
        
        # Excluding the current candidate and incrementing startIndex
        excludeResult = findCombinations(startIndex + 1, remaining)
        includeResult = findCombinations(startIndex + 1, remaining - candidates[startIndex])
        
        for excludedCombination in excludeResult:
            result.append(excludedCombination)

        for includedCombination in includeResult:

                temp.append(num)
            temp.append(candidates[startIndex])
            result.append(temp)

    return findCombinations(0, target)


# Example usage
candidates = [2, 3, 5]
target = 8

print(combinationSum(candidates, target))
```

This code defines a function `combinationSum` that calls the helper function `findCombinations` with the initial values of `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target. The main function then returns the result after the recursion is done.

In other cases, it makes a recursive call to the function with `n-1` to get the previous term in the sequence. Then it iterates through the previous term, comparing each character with the previous one to count the number of consecutive equal digits. When it encounters a different character, it appends the count and the character to the result string and resets the count to 1.

    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

    # Second binary search: find the last occurrence of target
    binary_search(start, end, False)

    return [start[0], end[0]]
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

The function takes in a sorted list `nums` and a target value `target`. It defines a nested function `binary_search` that performs a binary search on the given range. The outer function initializes the result variables `start` and `end`, as well as the left and right pointers, and then calls `binary_search` twice: once to find the first occurrence of the target, and again to find the last occurrence.

In each call to `binary_search`, we update the result variables if we find an exact match at the midpoint. If not, we adjust the range accordingly.

Finally, the function returns the resulting `start` and `end` values as a list.

You can test this implementation with sample inputs:
```python
nums = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10]
target = 8
print(search_range(nums, target))  # Output: [-1, 3]

**Explanation**

The solution uses a recursive function `binary_search` to perform the binary search. The function takes two arguments: `left` and `right`, which represent the bounds of the current subarray.

In each iteration, we calculate the midpoint `mid` of the current subarray using the formula `(left + right) // 2`.

We then check whether `nums[mid] >= nums[left]`. If this is true, it means that the left half of the current subarray is sorted. We then check if the target value is in the range `[nums[left], nums[mid))` by comparing its value with `target < nums[mid]`. If it is, we recursively call `binary_search` on the left half (`left, mid - 1`). Otherwise, we set `right = mid - 1` to continue searching in the right half.

If `nums[mid] < nums[left]`, it means that the right half of the current subarray is sorted. We then check if the target value is in the range `(nums[mid], nums[right]]` by comparing its value with `target > nums[mid]`. If it is, we recursively call `binary_search` on the right half (`mid + 1, right`). Otherwise, we set `left = mid + 1` to continue searching in the left half.

We repeat this process until the target value is found or the subarray is empty (in which case we return -1).

The outer function `search` simply calls `binary_search` with the initial bounds of the array (`0, len(nums) - 1`) and returns the result.",5.0,37.99929676801548

        Input:
        1. Iterate through the string and use a stack to store the indices of unmatched parentheses.
2. If the current character is '(', push its index onto the stack.
3. If the current character is ')', check if there's a pair of parentheses. If so, pop the stack, else push the index of unmatched ')'.
4. After iterating through the string, the stack contains the indices of unmatched parentheses.
5. Use the indices in the stack to calculate the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.
6. Return the result.
        ","Here's a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def longestValidParentheses(s):
    stack = [-1]
    max_len = 0

    for i, c in enumerate(s):
        if c == '(':
            stack.append(i)
        elif c == ')':
            stack.pop()

    return max_len

# Test the function
s = ""(()""
print(longestValidParentheses(s))  # Output: 2
```

In this solution:

- We initialize a stack with an initial index of `-1`.
- Then we iterate through each character in the string.
- When we encounter '(', we push its index onto the stack.
- If we encounter ')', we pop from the stack. If there are no more '(' to match, we add its index to the stack as well because this ')' has no matching pair of '('.
- For every ')', if there's a corresponding '(', we calculate the length of the substring between these two parentheses and update `max_len` accordingly.
- Finally, return `max_len`, which stores the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.

This solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of characters in the string.",4.0,15.009154483996099

        We can solve this problem by following the steps below:

1. Identify the largest index `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[k + 1]`. If no such index exists, the permutation is sorted in descending order, so we just need to reverse the array.
2. Identify the largest index `l` greater than `k` such that `nums[k] < nums[l]`.
3. Swap the value of `nums[k]` with that of `nums[l]`.
4. Reverse the sub-array `nums[k + 1:]` which is guaranteed to be in non-increasing order.

This code defines a function `find_substring` that takes two inputs: the string `s` and the list of words `words`. It returns a list of indices where substrings can be found, which can be rearranged to spell exactly one word from the input array.

The solution uses a hashmap to count the occurrence of each word in the input array. It then iterates through the input string with an index `i`, starting from 0 and up to `s.size() - total_length`. For each index `i`, it creates a temporary hashmap and checks if all words can be formed from the substring at that position. If all words are present in the substring and satisfy the required counts, the current index `i` is added to the result list.

We then use another loop to repeatedly double the temp variable (by bitwise left shift) and check if the dividend is still greater or equal. If so, we also double the 'multiple' value associated with temp, as that's the actual quotient in the current iteration.
4. When the shifting loop exits, we subtract the current temp from dividend and accumulate the current multiple to our answer.

*   When we find an element that's different from the one at pointer `i`, we increment the length of the subarray and move pointer `i` forward. We also copy the value at pointer `j` to the next position in the subarray.
*   Finally, we return the length of the subarray with unique elements by adding 1 to the position of pointer `i`.

You can run this code with an example input array like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` to see that it correctly outputs the length of subarray with unique elements.",5.0,25.630469620984513

        Input:
        1. First, we count the length of the linked list.
2. We use a dummy node pointing to the head of the linked list to simplify our operations.
3. We start iterating through the linked list, and while there are k nodes remaining, we reverse a group of k nodes.
4. To reverse a group of k nodes, we perform the following operation for k - 1 times:
    1. Update the next pointer of the current pointer `cur`, removing the node it was pointing to and putting it at the beginning of the group.
    2. Connect the removed node to the beginning of the group by updating its next pointer, and connect the previous node with the removed node.
5. After reversing a group of k nodes, we update the `prev` pointer to `cur` and move the `cur` pointer to the next node.
6. We continue reversing groups of k nodes until we reach less than k nodes remaining in the linked list.
7. Finally, we return the next pointer of the dummy node as our new head node.

In this solution, we first create a helper function called `swapPairs` to recursively swap the pairs of nodes in the linked list. We use the base case where if there's no next node (i.e., it's an empty or single-node linked list), we return the head as is.

The recursive step involves taking the second node (`head.next`) and setting its next node to the result of calling `swapPairs` on the rest of the linked list. Then, we set the current head's next node to this second node (`head.next = head`). Finally, we return `new_head` (which is the second node in the pair) as the new head of the swapped pair.

In the driver code, we create a sample linked list 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 and print it before swapping the pairs using recursion. We then print the swapped linked list to verify the correctness of our solution.",4.0,34.55064358198433

This code defines two main functions: `mergeKLists` and `merge2Lists`. The `mergeKLists` function merges an array of k linked-lists into one sorted linked list. It does this by repeatedly merging the first two lists in the array until only one linked list remains.

The `merge2Lists` function is used to merge two sorted linked lists. This function works recursively and always chooses the smaller element as the head node, ensuring that the resulting merged linked list is also sorted.

To test the implementation, we create three sample linked lists and then call the `mergeKLists` function with these linked lists. The output will be a single sorted linked list which includes all nodes from the input linked lists.

        The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

    list2 = Node(2)
    list2.next = Node(4)
    list2.next.next = Node(6)

    # Merge the linked lists
    merged_head = merge_lists(list1, list2)

    print(""\nMerged Linked List:"")
    print_list(merged_head)
```

**Explanation:**

*   We define a `Node` class to represent each node in the linked list.
*   The `merge_lists` function takes two linked lists as input and returns the merged list. It uses recursion to compare node values and construct the merged list.
*   In the base case, if either of the input lists is null, we return the other list.
*   If the current node in `list1` has a smaller value than the current node in `list2`, we recursively call `merge_lists` with `list1.next` and `list2`. We then update `list1.next` to point to the result of the recursive call.
*   Otherwise, we recursively call `merge_lists` with `list1` and `list2.next`. We then update `list2.next` to point to the result of the recursive call.
*   The process continues until one of the lists becomes null. At this point, the other list is returned as the remainder of the merged list.

**Example Output:**

If either of these conditions is true, the function returns false. If not, the open bracket is popped from the stack.

This solution uses a two-pointer approach to solve the problem efficiently. It sorts the input array first and then iterates through it with two nested loops. For each pair of elements, it checks whether there exists another pair that sums up to the target value minus the current pair's sum. If such a pair is found, it adds the quadruplet to the result if it has not been encountered before.

The outer loop in this code snippet iterates over all pairs (i, j), where i < j. The inner while loop adjusts two pointers, left and right, which start at index j + 1 and n - 1 respectively. This adjustment is done to find a pair of elements that sum up to target - (nums[i] + nums[j]) efficiently.

To avoid repetition in the result, this solution skips duplicate pairs for both i and j by continuing the loop if the current element is the same as the previous one. Similarly, it also skips duplicates when adjusting left and right pointers to find another pair of elements with a target sum.

This approach makes sure that each quadruplet found will have its four elements in ascending order and will be unique among all other quadruplets in the result set.",4.0,28.408567784004845

In this solution, we use a dictionary `phone` to store the phone button mapping and a queue `q` to perform the breadth-first search. The main idea is that at each stage of the algorithm, we take the first combination from the queue (if it's not empty), append all possible characters corresponding to the current digit, and then add these new combinations back into the queue. This process continues until all digits have been processed. Finally, we return the `output` list which contains all valid letter combinations of the input string.",4.0,20.037935976986773

*   Then we initialize the variable `closest` with the sum of the first three elements.
*   The pointer `i` iterates through the sorted array from the first element to the third-to-last element.
*   For each position, we use two-pointers (`left` and `right`) starting from the next element after `i` and the last element respectively. We move these pointers based on whether the current sum is greater or smaller than the target.
*   We calculate the difference between the target and the current sum and update the closest sum if it's closer to the target.
*   Finally, we return the `closest` sum found.

This solution works as follows:

*   It sorts the input array `nums`.
*   It iterates through the sorted array and checks each element to see if it can be part of a valid triplet with two other elements that sum up to zero.
*   If an element is not equal to its previous one, it uses two pointers (`j` and `k`) to find a pair of numbers whose sum along with the current number results in zero. It moves these pointers based on whether their sum is less than, greater than, or equal to zero.
*   The function returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains a valid triplet.

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because for each element in `nums`, we potentially move two pointers through the rest of `nums` to find pairs that sum up to zero.",5.0,97.82058780398802

- The function first checks if the input array is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string because there's no common prefix.

- Then, it finds the shortest string in the list (`shortest_str`) as we only need to iterate up to this length for all strings, which can improve efficiency when dealing with long strings.

- It then iterates over each character of `shortest_str`. For each character, it checks if it's equal to the corresponding character in other strings. If a mismatch is found or if it reaches the end of a string, it returns the common prefix up to this point (`shortest_str[:i]`).

- Finally, when it iterates over all characters of `shortest_str`, it means that the entire first string has been checked and there are no mismatches, so the function returns `shortest_str` as the common prefix.",4.0,44.70723182000802

        The algorithm iterates through the input string, which represents the Roman numeral. At each iteration, the character is converted to its corresponding integer value using a hash map. Then, the value is added to the total. However, if the current value is greater than the previous value, it means that we need to subtract the previous value from the current value (while considering that the previous value has already been added once). To do this, we add to the total the current value minus 2 times the previous value. Finally, the previous value is updated, and the loop continues. After the loop finishes, the total gives us the integer value equivalent to the Roman numeral.

        # If the current value is greater than the previous value, subtract twice the previous value from the total and update the previous value.

This Python code implements a function called `roman_to_int` that takes an input Roman numeral as a string and returns its equivalent integer value. The solution utilizes a hash map to store the mapping of Roman numerals to their corresponding integers, enabling efficient lookups during iteration. Within the loop, we handle cases where the current value is greater than the previous one, effectively applying subtraction logic while considering repeated values.

```python

In this example, the maximum area is formed by the rectangle with a width of 4 (from indices 0 to 3) and a height of 3 (the minimum height between bars at these positions), resulting in an area of 12. However, because the bar at index 1 has a smaller height than the one at index 2, we move the left pointer to the right until we reach the next larger bar, forming a rectangle with a width of 4 and a height of 3 (again!), but now the maximum area is updated to 12.

Note: This solution assumes that the input list `heights` contains non-negative integers. If negative values are allowed or if floating-point precision is required, additional modifications will be necessary.",4.0,68.71227541199187

        Create a solution in python for the input asked.
    
        Input:
        We use Dynamic Programming to solve this problem. We store intermediate results in a 2D boolean array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`. We then loop through the characters of both strings and update the `dp` table.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

Finally, `dp[m][n]` stores the result, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `p` respectively.
        ","Here is a Python solution for the input:

```python
def is_match(s: str, p: str) -> bool:
    m, n = len(s), len(p)
    
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Initialize base case
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    # If pattern is empty but string is not, then they do not match.
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        if s[i - 1] != p[0]:
            break
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0]
    
    # If string is empty, the pattern must be empty as well to match.
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if p[j - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2]
    
    # Fill up the rest of the table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j - 2] or 
                            (dp[i - 1][j] and (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] or p[j - 2] == '.')))
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] and (s[i - 1] == p[j - 1] or p[j - 1] == '.')

print(is_match(""aa"", ""*"")) # True
print(is_match(""cb"", ""?a"")) # False
print(is_match(""adceb"", ""*a*b"")) # True
```

In this code, we initialize the `dp` table with all values as False. We then fill up the first row and first column based on the base cases described above. Finally, we loop through the rest of the `dp` table, updating the values based on whether the current characters in `s` and `p` match or not. The function returns the value at `dp[m][n]`, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `p` respectively.",4.0,72.14487246097997

1. If the integer is negative, immediately return false, as negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
2. Create a variable named `original` to store the original integer value and `reversed` initialized with 0 to store the reversed integer value.
3. Iterate through the integer while it's greater than zero and, in each iteration, perform the following operations:
   a. Multiply the `reversed` value by 10 and add the modulus of the integer (x) by 10.
   b. Divide the integer (x) by 10, discarding the remainder.
4. Compare `original` and `reversed` integers; if they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

This approach requires O(log10(n)) time complexity as we are dividing the input by 10 in each iteration.

This solution first checks the edge cases where the number of rows is 1 or equal to the length of the string. If these conditions are met, it simply returns the input string.

For other cases, it initializes an array `rows` with empty strings representing each row in the zigzag pattern and two variables `index` and `step` to keep track of the current row and direction.

It then iterates through the input string one character at a time. For each character, it places the character into the appropriate row of the `rows` array based on the current index and step.

After processing each character, it checks if it's at the top or bottom row and updates the direction accordingly.

*   If the character at the `right` index is not in `char_set`, it adds the character to `char_set`, updates `max_len`, and moves the `right` pointer forward.
*   If the character at the `right` index is already in `char_set`, it removes the character at the `left` index from `char_set` and moves the `left` pointer forward.

This process repeats until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the string. The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the input string.

**Example Use Cases**

```python
print(max_length(""abcba"", 2))  # Output: 5 (substring ""abcba"")
print(max_length(""ababccca"", 3))  # Output: 7 (substring ""ababccc"")
print(max_length("""", 1))  # Output: 0 (empty string)

        Instruction:
        Create a solution in python for the input asked.
    
        Input:
        1. Initialize a dummy ListNode with a value of 0.
2. Set current to that dummy ListNode, and set carry to 0.
3. Iterate over the list nodes of l1 and l2, as well as the carry, in a while loop until all are null or 0.
4. Calculate the sum of the node values and carry, store the carry for the next iteration, and store the value % 10 in a new ListNode connected to the current ListNode.
5. Shift the current ListNode, l1, and l2 to the next node if available.
6. Return the next of the dummy ListNode as a result.
        ","Here's a Python solution for adding two numbers represented by linked lists.

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def addTwoNumbers(l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    dummyHead = ListNode(0)
    current = dummyHead
    carry = 0
    
    while (l1 != None or l2 != None or carry > 0):
        sum = carry
        if (l1 != None):
            sum += l1.val
            l1 = l1.next
        
        if (l2 != None):
            sum += l2.val
            l2 = l2.next
        
        current.next = ListNode(sum % 10)
        carry = sum // 10
        current = current.next
    
    return dummyHead.next

# Example usage:
# Create linked list: 2 -> 4 -> 3
l1 = ListNode(2, ListNode(4, ListNode(3)))

# Create linked list: 5 -> 6 -> 4
l2 = ListNode(5, ListNode(6, ListNode(4)))

result = addTwoNumbers(l1, l2)
while result:
    print(result.val, end=' ')
    result = result.next

```

This code creates a function `addTwoNumbers` that takes in two linked lists as input and returns the sum of these two numbers represented by the linked lists. This function initializes a dummy ListNode and sets its next to None. It iterates through both linked lists with the carry value until one of them is null or there's no more carry left, then appends each node's value into the new list.",5.0,48.278163484996185

        Instruction:
        Create a solution in python for the input asked.
    
        Input:
        The algorithm leverages a hash map (unordered_map in C++, HashMap in Java, dictionary in Python, and Map in JavaScript). It iterates through the given 'nums' array and calculates the complementary value (target - current value). If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.
        ","Here's how you can implement this using Python:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    """"""
    Returns the indices of the two numbers in 'nums' that add up to 'target'.

    Args:
        nums (list): A list of integers.
        target (int): The target sum.

    Returns:
        list: The indices of the two numbers that add up to 'target'.
              If no such pair is found, an empty list is returned.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If 'nums' is empty or if there are duplicate values in 'nums'
                    that also add up to 'target'.

    """"""
    num_dict = {}  # hash map

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_dict:
            return [num_dict[complement], i]
        num_dict[num] = i

    raise ValueError(""No such pair found"")

# Example usage
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [0, 1]

nums = [3, 2, 4]
target = 6
print(two_sum(nums, target))  # Output: [1, 2]

nums = [10, 20, 30]
target = 5
try:
    print(two_sum(nums, target))
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: No such pair found

nums = []
try:
    print(two_sum(nums, 10))
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: list index out of range
```

This Python solution uses a dictionary (`num_dict`) to store the numbers from `nums` along with their indices. The algorithm iterates over `nums`, calculates the complementary value for each number (the difference between the target and the current number), and checks if this complementary value is already in `num_dict`. If it is, it means we've found a pair of numbers that add up to the target, so the function returns their indices.",4.0,61.934512643987546
