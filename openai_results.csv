        Input:
        The algorithm used is a recursive depth-first traversal of both trees. It will compare the nodes at each level of the tree, and return false if the nodes have different values or if one node is missing in one of the trees. The algorithm will only return true if all nodes in both trees are the same.

At each level, the function checks if both nodes are null, indicating we've reached the end of both trees and they must be the same. Then it checks if either node is null, indicating that one tree is missing a node and they cannot be the same. If both nodes have the same value, we then recursively check their left and right children. If both children are the same, the function returns true. If at any point nodes are found to be different, the function returns false.

        Input:
        We will solve this problem using the Inorder traversal of the binary search tree.

1. Traverse the BST using Inorder traversal, and at each node, compare its value with the previous node.
2. If the previous node's value is greater than the current node's value, it means they are swapped. So, mark the first such node as `first` and the second such node as `second`.
3. After completing the Inorder traversal, swap the values of the `first` and `second` nodes.
4. This approach is implemented in all four languages: C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.

Note that the TreeNode class should be defined for each implementation as it's not provided in the problem statement.

        Input:
        The algorithm follows a simple recursive approach to determine if a given binary tree is a valid Binary Search Tree (BST). The key idea is to maintain a range for each node, which is defined by the minimum and maximum values that the node's value should be within. For example, the root node's value should be in the range of (-Infinity, Infinity). When traversing to the left child, the maximum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value, and for traversing to the right child, the minimum value for the range should be updated to the parent's value. The algorithm continues recursively in this manner.

A helper function, `isValidBSTHelper`, is defined and initialized with the root and the range (-Infinity, Infinity). If the node is `null`, it means that we have reached a leaf node and it should return `true`. If the value of the node is not within the specified range, it means that the node does not meet the BST requirement and the helper function should return `false`. If the node is valid, then the helper function proceeds to check for valid BSTs in its left and right subtrees with the updated range.

If so, we take the value of the previous dp[i-1] or dp[j-1] accordingly if the characters match.

1. Traverse the left subtree, and call the function recursively for the left child.
2. Visit the root.

In each call to the function, we try to add one part to the IP address. If 4 parts have been added and we have reached the end of the input string, we have found a valid IP address and add it to the result list.

The algorithm iterates through the string s, starting at the current index. It keeps track of the current number (0-255) being constructed by multiplying the current number by 10 and adding the current digit. If the current number is greater than 255, we break the iteration.

We then call the dfs function recursively, with the current index incremented by one, the current IP appended with the current character and a dot, and incrementing part by 1. If the current number is 0 (which indicates a leading zero), we also break the iteration.

This process is repeated for all valid parts and combinations, eventually forming all possible valid IP addresses.

        Input:
        1. Create two new ListNodes: less_head and more_head. These will act as head pointers for partitions of nodes that have values less than x and greater than or equal to x.
2. Initialize two pointers, less_ptr and more_ptr, to point to the dummy head nodes just created.
3. Iterate through the original linked list. For each node, compare its value with the given x.
4. If the current node's value is less than x, append it to the partition pointed by less_ptr, and move less_ptr forward.
5. If the current node's value is greater than or equal to x, append it to the partition pointed by more_ptr, and move more_ptr forward.
6. Perform the above steps until the entire linked list has been traversed.
7. After iterating through the linked list, connect the end of the less partition with the start of the more partition.
8. Move the more_ptr to the end of its partition setting the its next to null.
9. Return the head of the new partitioned linked list, which is less_head.next

        Input:
        The algorithm utilizes a stack to keep track of the indices of the heights array. It starts iterating through the array, appending a zero at the end to ensure the last bar is considered. When a higher bar is found, it is pushed onto the stack, and if a lower bar is found, it calculates the area of the bar under the current top of the stack considering the width between the current bar and the next lowest bar in the stack, storing the highest area found.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) as it iterates through the heights only once, resulting in optimal performance.

        Input:
        The algorithm to delete all duplicates in a sorted linked list simply iterates through the list and compares the value of the current node with the value of the next. If both values are the same, it means that there is a duplicate, so the current node's ""next"" pointer is updated to point to the node after the duplicate. If the values are different, the algorithm continues iterating to the next node. The process continues until reaching the end of the list. Since the linked list is already sorted, this algorithm guarantees that duplicates will appear consecutively, allowing for their removal in linear time.

        Input:
        The algorithm uses a dummy node to simplify the handling of the head node of the linked list. We declare two pointers: `prev` and `curr` which are pointers to the previous and current nodes, respectively. 

The algorithm iterates through the list with the current pointer. If the current node's value is equal to the next node's value, we continue moving the current pointer along the duplicate values. Once we reach the end of duplicates, we check if the previous node's next pointer is pointing to the current node. If it is, it means there were no duplicates (prev and curr are consecutive), so we move the `prev` pointer to the current node. Otherwise, we set `prev.next` to `curr.next` to skip the duplicates. 

Finally, we move the current pointer to the next node, and repeat the process. The resulting list will have all duplicates removed, and the changes will persist as the dummy node is used to reference the head of the modified list.

        The algorithm is based on a modified binary search. We start by setting two pointers named `left` and `right` at the first and last element of the array, respectively. We then enter a loop, which continues until the `left` pointer is less than or equal to the `right` pointer.

Inside the loop, we first calculate the middle index `mid` using the `left` and `right` pointers. If the middle element of the array is equal to the target, we return true, indicating that the target is found.

If the middle element is equal to the left element, we increment the `left` pointer. If the middle element is greater than the left element, we check if the target is within the left and middle elements. If it is, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one. Otherwise, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one.

If the middle element is still smaller than the left element, we then check if the target is within the middle and right elements. If it is, we set the `left` pointer to the middle index plus one. Otherwise, we set the `right` pointer to the middle index minus one.

After the loop, we return false if the target is not found in the array.

4. Check the validity by comparing `valid` with the length of `t`.
    - If valid, update the answer substring's `start` and `length` if the current window's length is less than the current minimum.
    - Then, increment the `left` pointer to slide the window until the current character count in the window goes below the count in `need`. Update the `valid` counter accordingly.

Likewise, `blue` is responsible for tracking the position where the next 2 should be swapped to, starting from the end of the array. `white` is responsible for iterating through the array.

While `white` is less than or equal to `blue`, check the current `nums[white]` value. If it is 0, swap it with the value at index `red`, and increment both `red` and `white`.

        The algorithm uses binary search on an m x n matrix.

Firstly, the number of rows and columns (m and n) are computed. Then, we initialize the left and right pointers (l and r).

In each step of the binary search, we calculate the middle index (mid) and get the corresponding value (mid_val) in the matrix. To get the value in the matrix, we divide mid by n and take the remainder.

We then compare the mid_val with the target. If it is equal to the target, we return true. If it's less than the target, we move the left pointer to the next position (mid + 1). Otherwise, we move the right pointer (mid - 1).

If the search space has been fully explored and the target is not found, we return false.

        The algorithm used is dynamic programming. We create a 2D table dp with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1), where m is the length of word1 and n is the length of word2. Each cell dp[i][j] represents the minimum number of operations required to convert word1[0...i-1] to word2[0...j-1].

For each cell, we have the following conditions:
1. If either i or j is 0, it means one of the strings is empty, so the minimum number of operations needed is the length of the non-empty string (i or j).
2. If the current characters of the two strings are equal (word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]), we don't have to do anything, so dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1].
3. If the current characters are different, we take the minimum of the following and add 1:
    a. dp[i-1][j]: Delete operation
    b. dp[i][j-1]: Insert operation
    c. dp[i-1][j-1]: Replace operation

After filling the table, the minimum number of operations will be at dp[m][n].

Initially, we fill out the first row and first column of the `dp` array with 1 since there is only one way to reach any cell in the first row or first column: by moving either right along the first row or down along the first column.

Then, for every other cell in the `dp` array, we can calculate the number of unique paths to that cell by summing the number of unique paths to the cell above it and to the cell to its left. We can do this because the robot can only move down or right, so the paths to the current cell must have come from those two directions.

Finally, we return the value at the bottom-right corner of the `dp` array, which represents the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach the destination.

        Input:
        The algorithm uses factorials and a list of available numbers to construct the kth permutation. 

First, we precompute the factorials up to n using a loop.

Next, we initialize an array or list of available numbers, from 1 to n.

Then, we iterate from n down to 1, calculating the index of the current number in the available list to be included in the resulting permutation. We can calculate it as follows: `index = (k - 1) // factorials[i - 1]`. 

After, we update the value of k to: `k %= factorials[i - 1]`.

At each step, we append or concatenate the chosen number to the result and remove it from the list of available numbers.

Finally, we return the result as a string.

        The algorithm recursively places queens on columns and checks if the placement is safe, i.e., no queens are attacking each other. 
1. Maintain an array `cols` storing the row indices of placed queens. The index in this array represents the column the queen is placed in. This ensures that no two queens are placed in the same column.
2. Recursively place queens (column-wise).
3. Check for a safe position for each queen in the current column:
   a. Check for same row (`cols[i] == row`).
   b. Check for diagonal attack (`abs(i - col) == abs(cols[i] - row)`).
4. If the current position is safe, place the queen in the current column at the current row position, and continue to place the next queen.
5. If all queens are placed, increment the solution count.
6. If the recursive call finishes, backtrack by removing the queen from the current column and move on to the next row in the same column.
7. The base case is when the `cols` size equals `n`, meaning all queens have been placed safely; increment the count.

This approach considers all possible configurations for placing the n queens while avoiding visiting invalid configurations. It uses backtracking to explore the state space efficiently. The algorithm finds the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

        The algorithm uses the binary exponentiation technique, which is a faster method of calculating x^n compared to the naive approach. It relies on the process of repeatedly multiplying the current product by itself and updating it after each iteration. The loop iterates through the bits of the exponent n, from the least significant to the most significant. If the current bit of n is 1, the result is multiplied by the current product. At the end of the loop, the current product is updated by squaring it. This process continues until all bits of the exponent have been processed.

The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(n)) because the loop iterates through the bits of n, and the number of bits in n is proportional to the logarithm of n. The space complexity is O(1), as the space used by the temporary variables does not depend on the size of n.

        Input:
        We use backtracking to generate permutations. Firstly, we sort the `nums` array to make sure that duplicate numbers are located together. Then, for each recursive backtracking call, we swap the elements in the range `[start, len(nums) - 1]` with `nums[start]`, ignoring already-visited elements by using a `visited` array.

We also skip any element that is equal to the current `start` element to avoid duplicates. After generating a valid permutation by iterating through all indices, we append the current permutation to the result array. When backtracking, we maintain the original order of elements before moving to the next level.

The time complexity of this approach is O(n! * n) since there are n! available permutations and each permutation requires O(n) time to build the solution. The space complexity is O(n) to store the `visited` array and temporary lists.

        Input:
        The algorithm uses backtracking to generate all possible permutations. It works by swapping the elements in the input array in a recursive manner.

1. The base case is when the index reaches the last element of the array; at this point, we append the current configuration to the ""results"" list.
2. For each index, we iterate from `index` to the end of the array, performing the following steps:
    a. Swap `index` and `i` elements.
    b. Recursively call the helper function with `index + 1`.
    c. Swap the elements back to their original positions.

This will generate all possible permutations, as it swaps elements in different positions while maintaining the original order in the input array. The termination condition for the recursion is the base case when we reach the end of the array. The complexity of this algorithm is O(N!), as there are N! permutations of an array of N elements.

        Input:
        The algorithm uses a two-pointer approach, initializing left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the elevation map, respectively. It also initializes two variables `maxLeft` and `maxRight` to keep track of the maximum heights on the left and right of the pointers, as well as a variable `water` to store the trapped water.

The algorithm iterates through the elevation map until the left pointer is less than the right pointer. In each iteration, it compares the values at both pointers to determine which side is shorter. If the value at the left pointer is less than or equal to the value at the right pointer, it means water can be trapped on the left side up to the height of the shorter bar. The algorithm updates `maxLeft` with the maximum height on the left side and then adds the trapped water (which is the difference between the maximum height and the current height) to the `water` variable. The left pointer is then incremented. If the value at the right pointer is smaller, the same logic is applied to the right side and the right pointer is decremented.

This process is repeated until the left pointer is no longer less than the right pointer, at which point the total trapped water has been calculated and the `water` variable is returned. This algorithm has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1) as it only uses constant extra space.

        The algorithm is a recursive backtracking algorithm. We define a helper function `findCombinations` that takes the following parameters:

1. `startIndex`: the index of the candidates array from which it can start choosing numbers.
2. `remaining`: the remaining sum needed to reach the target.

The base cases are:
- If `remaining` is 0, it means we have found a valid combination, so we return a list containing an empty list.
- If `startIndex` is equal to the length of candidates, or `remaining` is negative, there are no valid combinations, so we return an empty list.

In the function, we first initialize an empty list called `result`. Then, we make two recursive calls to `findCombinations`:

1. Excluding the current candidate at `startIndex` and incrementing `startIndex`, to search for combinations without this candidate.
2. Including the current candidate in the combination, and decreasing `remaining` accordingly (without updating `startIndex`).

After getting results from both recursive calls, we merge them and return the final list of combinations.

The main function `combinationSum` calls `findCombinations` with `startIndex` as 0 and `remaining` as the target, and returns the result after the recursion is done.

This script uses a recursive backtracking approach to fill in the Sudoku board. It starts by searching for an empty cell, tries each possible number from 1 to 9, and checks if its placement is valid based on Sudoku rules. If inserting a number fails to lead to a valid solution, it reverts that cell to '.' and tries the next number. The process is repeated until a valid board is created or all possibilities have failed.

The `is_valid` function checks if a given number can be placed at a specific position in the board without violating Sudoku rules. It takes into account the existence of the number in the same row, column, or 3x3 grid. The `solve_sudoku` function uses this helper function to recursively fill in the board with valid numbers.

Note that this script assumes the input board is a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the Sudoku board and contains strings representing the cell values (with '.' indicating an empty cell).",5.0,17.467935458000284

        The given problem requires a binary search algorithm. We define two pointers, `left` and `right`, initially set to the first and last index of the array. We then enter a loop that continues as long as left is less than or equal to right. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index, `mid`, as the average of left and right. If the value at this middle index is equal to the target value, we return the middle index. If the middle value is less than the target value, we set left to `mid + 1`, meaning we search the right half of the remaining array. If the middle value is greater than the target value, we set the right to `mid - 1`, meaning we search the left half of the remaining array. After the loop, if the target value is not found, we return the value of the left pointer, which represents the index where the target value should be inserted.

This code implements a binary search algorithm with optimizations for handling edge cases and improving efficiency. It first checks if the input array is empty and returns -1 in this case to indicate that the target value was not found. If the array has only one element, it checks if that element matches the target value and returns its index accordingly. Otherwise, the code enters a loop where it calculates the middle index of the current range and compares the value at this index with the target value. Depending on the result of this comparison, it updates either the left or right pointer to focus the search on one half of the array. After the loop completes without finding the target value, the code returns the index of the left pointer, which is the position where the target value should be inserted.",4.0,14.146043102999101

        The algorithm is a variation of binary search. The main idea is to decide whether the target is in the left or the right half of the current subarray. If nums[mid] >= nums[left], the left half is sorted. If target is in the range [nums[left], nums[mid]), set right = mid - 1. Otherwise, set left = mid + 1. If nums[mid] < nums[left], the right half must be sorted. If target is in the range (nums[mid], nums[right]], set left = mid + 1. Otherwise, set right = mid - 1. Continue the process until the target is found or the subarray is empty, in which case return -1. This algorithm has a runtime complexity of O(log n) because it eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step, similar to a binary search.

If the element at `j` is not equal to `val`, we place it at the position `i` and increment the `i` pointer. The loop continues until we have checked all the elements in the array. The `i` pointer will give us the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is the result. Thus, we return the value of `i` as the final result.

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array, as we only iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) since we do not use any extra memory. We modify the input array in-place.

        Input:
        The algorithm uses recursion to solve the problem. It starts by checking if the list has remaining pairs to swap. If not, the head of the current section of the list is returned.

If there are pairs left to swap, it takes the second node (which will become the new head of the current pair) and sets its next node to the result of the recursive call with the node after it as the new head.

Then, it sets the current head's next node to the second node and returns the second node as the new head of the pair. As the recursion unfolds, the pairs get swapped, and the final swapped linked list head is returned.

        Input:
        The algorithm follows a divide and conquer approach to merge all linked lists into one sorted linked-list. 

1. If the given array of linked-lists is empty, we return a null pointer.
2. The main function `mergeKLists` merges the first two lists in the array of linked-lists and appends the results (merged list) at the end of the array. It will then remove the merged lists from the beginning of the array. This process is repeated until only one linked-list remains in the array.
3. The function `merge2Lists` is used for merging two sorted linked-lists. The smallest element of the two lists is chosen as the head node and recursively merged with the rest of the lists.

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(kN) and a space complexity of O(1), where k is the number of linked-lists, and N is the total number of nodes across all linked-lists.

        Input:
        The algorithm uses a helper function called `generateParenthesisHelper` which receives four parameters: the number of open parentheses left to place, the number of close parentheses left to place, the current string that holds the generated parentheses so far, and the result list to store valid combinations.

The algorithm uses a depth-first search to construct valid combinations of parentheses. It starts with `n` open parentheses and increments the number of close parentheses as it places an open parenthesis. When the helper function has no open or close parentheses left to place, it means a valid combination is found, so it adds the combination to the result list.

The helper function recursively calls itself. If there are open parentheses left to place, it calls itself with one less open parenthesis and one more close parenthesis. If there are close parentheses left to place, it calls itself without changing the number of open parentheses and with one less close parenthesis. Finally, the current string in each case is updated with the placed open or close parenthesis.

2. Compare the values of the nodes in `list1` and `list2`.
3. If `list1` node value is smaller, set `list1.next` to the result of recursively calling the function with `list1.next` and `list2`.

        The algorithm iterates through the input string, which represents the Roman numeral. At each iteration, the character is converted to its corresponding integer value using a hash map. Then, the value is added to the total. However, if the current value is greater than the previous value, it means that we need to subtract the previous value from the current value (while considering that the previous value has already been added once). To do this, we add to the total the current value minus 2 times the previous value. Finally, the previous value is updated, and the loop continues. After the loop finishes, the total gives us the integer value equivalent to the Roman numeral.

        We use Dynamic Programming to solve this problem. We store intermediate results in a 2D boolean array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`. We then loop through the characters of both strings and update the `dp` table.

If the current characters in `s` and `p` are equal or `p` has a '.', we update the `dp[i][j]` to the value `dp[i - 1][j - 1]`, because the match continues.

If the current character in `p` is '*', we have two options:

1. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as 0 occurrences. We update the `dp[i][j]` value to `dp[i][j - 2]`.
2. Consider the matching of the previous character in `p` as at least 1 occurrence. We update `dp[i][j]` to the value of `dp[i - 1][j] && (s[i - 1] == p[j - 2] || p[j - 2] == '.')`.

Finally, `dp[m][n]` stores the result, where `m` and `n` are the lengths of strings `s` and `p` respectively.

1. If the integer is negative, immediately return false, as negative numbers cannot be palindromes.
2. Create a variable named `original` to store the original integer value and `reversed` initialized with 0 to store the reversed integer value.
3. Iterate through the integer while it's greater than zero and, in each iteration, perform the following operations:
   a. Multiply the `reversed` value by 10 and add the modulus of the integer (x) by 10.
   b. Divide the integer (x) by 10, discarding the remainder.
4. Compare `original` and `reversed` integers; if they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

This approach requires O(log10(n)) time complexity as we are dividing the input by 10 in each iteration.

If the complementary value is already in the hash map, it means that we found a solution, and we return those indices. If the complement is not in the hash map, we store the current element in the hash map with its index. If the algorithm doesn't find the solution, it returns an empty array or throws an exception (in Java).

This approach has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n) as well.
        ","```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_dict = {}
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        
        if complement not in num_dict:
            num_dict[num] = i
            
        else:
            return [num_dict[complement], i]
            
    return []
```

Or with early return mechanism:

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    num_dict = {}
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        
        if complement not in num_dict:
            num_dict[num] = i
            
        else:
            return [num_dict[complement], i]
            
    return []
